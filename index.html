            <h1>The History of Coffee</h1>
            <p>No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are many legends about its
                origin.Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the
                Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these
                beloved beans.

                The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a
                certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.

                Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and
                found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery
                with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

                As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula, it began a journey which would bring these
                beans across the globe.</p>
            <p>Light roasts
                Light brown in color, this roast is generally preferred for milder coffee varieties. There will be no
                oil on the surface of these beans because they are not roasted long enough for the oils to break through
                to the surface.</p>

                Medium roasts
                This roast is medium brown in color with a stronger flavor and a non-oily surface. It’s often referred
                to as the American roast because it is generally preferred in the United States.</p>

                Medium dark roasts
                Rich, dark color, this roast has some oil on the surface and with a slight bittersweet aftertaste.</p>

            <p>Full City
                Dark roasts
                This roast produces shiny black beans with an oily surface and a pronounced bitterness. The darker the
                roast, the less acidity will be found in the coffee beverage. Dark roast coffees run from slightly dark
                to charred, and the names are often used interchangeably — be sure to check your beans before you buy
                them!</p>
